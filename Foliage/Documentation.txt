Thanks for considering my package!

This package was my first attempt at creating tools for unity and is very crude. It is unlikely but more updates may come in the future.

Please feel free to suggest any changes or upgrades.

I would appreciate if you credit me in any reuploads of this product!

HOW TO USE:

Navigate to "Window/FolageGenerator" and open it (you are able to change the directory in the script).

Once opened assign an object to cover in foliage, currenly you can only do square planes.

Now assign the foliages properties,
 - Foliage Density (be careful with this value as it can get dense easily)
 - Foliage Size, assign a min and a max size for the foliage.
 
Now you can select "Add Foliage Mesh" and assign a mesh (you can have multiple meshes here)

Generate the foliage by clicking the "Generate Folage" button
and remove the last placed foliage bundle by clicking the "Remove Foliage" button
if you cannot remove the foliage you can locate the ground object in the heirchy and
delete the child "Grass" to remove all foliage.

Randomizers:

Click add randomize script to add a randomizer to the ground object, if you open the ground object you will see a class
displaying some variables that you can change, adjusting these will diffrentiate the foliage details.

When you press play, the foliage should generate randomly on the ground object and remove when you leave play mode.

Clicking remove randomize script will remove the randomizer.
